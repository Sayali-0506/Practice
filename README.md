What is a Linear Search?

A linear search, also known as a sequential search, is a method of finding an element within a list. It checks each element of the list sequentially until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

A simple approach to implement a linear search is -

Begin with the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element.

If x matches with an element then return the index.

If x does not match with any of the elements then return -1.
