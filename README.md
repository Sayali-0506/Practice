What is a Linear Search?

A linear search, also known as a sequential search, is a method of finding an element within a list. It checks each element of the list sequentially until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

## A simple approach to implement a linear search is -

1. First, we have to traverse the array elements using a for loop.
2. In each iteration of for loop, compare the search element with the current array element, and -
3. If the element matches, then return the index of the corresponding array element.
4. If the element does not match, then move to the next element.
5. If there is no match or the search element is not present in the given array, return -1.
